Fish-Scala
==========

This is a quick Go-Fish game for coding experimentation.

I wanted to learn Scala.  Fish, Scala?  Amusing enough to run with it.

Overall, it's almost certainly not _good_ Scala, but it has enough basic functionality to get a taste of the language.

And obviously, the game isn't complete, so I would avoid using it for any major competitive purposes, assuming that's a thing.
